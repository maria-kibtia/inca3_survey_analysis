📋 Overview
This repository contains an rmd file (inca3_analysis.rmd), where a national dataset was used to analyze and present data, using R. This was part of a university course module´s evaluation.
The primary objective of the analysis was to determine if there is an association between daily protein intake and level of physical activity among adult French females in the Inca3 survey. 
The secondary objective was to create a parsimonious descriptive model using some predictor variables and reporting the prediction accuracy of the model. 
The project involved merging datasets, data cleaning, descriptive analysis, regression modeling, and visualization.
